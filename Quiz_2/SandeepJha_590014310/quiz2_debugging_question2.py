# A student implemented the "First Non-Repeating Character" algorithm but it's giving wrong results:

#original code
''' 
def first_non_repeating(s):
    char_count = {}
    # Count frequencies
    for char in s:
        char_count[char] = char_count.get(char, 0) + 1
    # Find first non-repeating by original order
    for idx, char in enumerate(s):

'''

# Tasks:
# 1. Identify the bug in the algorithm
#Ans -> The second loop iterates over char_count, which is a dictionary. 
# Dictionaries in Python do not preserve the order of characters as they appear in the string

# 2. Explain why the current approach gives incorrect results
'''Ans -> The function should return the index of the first character in the string that appears only once.
By looping over char_count, you may not check characters in the order they appear in the string.
The main issue is that the function should check the string in its original order, not the order of unique characters. '''
# 3. Provide the corrected implementation

    char_count = {}

        char_count[char] = char_count.get(char, 0) + 1
